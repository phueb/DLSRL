# DLSRL

## Background

An implementation of the semantic role labeling model reported in He et al. (2017) using tensorflow. 

The paper describing the original implementation can be found here: 
[Deep Semantic Role Labeling: What works and what's next](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luheng/files/acl2017_hllz.pdf)

Built at the [NCSA GPU Hackathon](https://bluewaters.ncsa.illinois.edu/bw-hackathon-2018)

## Goal

The code is for research propose only. 
The goal of this research project is to understand early language acquisition, specifically how do children comprehend utterances in terms of who is doing what to whom?
